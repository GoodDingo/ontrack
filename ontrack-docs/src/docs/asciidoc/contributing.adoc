=== Branching strategy

* development of features always goes to `feature/` branches
* the branches are created from:
** the `master` branch for version 2
** the `v3` branch for version 3
* new releases are created by branching from `develop` (V2)
or `master` (V3), using `release/2.' or `release/3.` as a prefix
* pull requests must be made from the `master` branch

The versioning is automated using the
https://github.com/nemerosa/versioning[Gradle Versioning plug-in]. No file
needs to be updated to set the version.
