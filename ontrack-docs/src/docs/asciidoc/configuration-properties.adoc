=== Configuration properties

Ontrack uses the Spring Boot mechanism for its configuration. See
the <<configuration,documentation>> on how to set those properties
in your Ontrack installation.

All http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#common-application-properties[Spring Boot properties]
are available for configuration.

Additionally, Ontrack defines the following ones.

TIP: The names of the configuration properties are given for a `.properties`
     file format but you can configure them in YAML of course. They can also
     be provided as system properties or environment variables. See the
     http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-properties-and-configuration[Spring Boot documentation]
     for more details.


WARNING: This sample file is meant as a guide only. Do *not* copy/paste the
         entire content into your application; rather pick only the properties
         that you need.

TIP: When applicable, the default value is mentioned.

# Scattering ratio. Maximum fraction of the period to take into account for the
# scattering. For example, setting 0.5 would not add a dealy greater than half
# the period of the job. Setting 0 would actually disable the scattering altogether.
