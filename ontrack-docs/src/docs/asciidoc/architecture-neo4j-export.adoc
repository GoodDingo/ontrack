==== Export to Neo4J

The `neo4j` extension allows an administrator to
<<appendix-neo4j-export,export>> the Ontrack to https://neo4j.com/[Neo4J].

After having filled some input data, the data is exported asynchronously
in a set of CSV files. When done, the whole set of files can be downloaded
as a ZIP file.

The diagram below shows the orchestration of the controller and the services.
